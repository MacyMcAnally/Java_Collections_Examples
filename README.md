# Java_Collections_Examples
This this repo, it will break it down into 4 sections: List, Set, Queue, and Map, These 4 sections are the interfaces implements the Collection interface from the Collections framework in Java.

## List
In the List interface, it allows duplicate elements in the List and containers the insertion order. There are few classes that implements List interface:
- ArrayList:
  - Dynamic - Array (Increase the size by 50%) 
  - Compare to LinkedList, it is slower on inserting elements in the ArrayList
  - Compare to LinkedList, it is faster on searching elements (becasue of the index)
  - Examples can be found in the package 'list' => ArrayListExample
- LinkedList:
  - Double - LinkedList 
  - Utilize nodes 
  - Compare to ArrayList, it performs faster on inserting elements in the LinkedList
  - Compare to ArrayList, it performs slower on searching elements
  - Examples can be found in the package 'list' => LinkedListExample
- etc




## Set



## Queue



## Map
